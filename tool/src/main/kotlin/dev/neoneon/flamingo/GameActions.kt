/**
 * The half-move number [fen] belongs to: the ply about to be played from that position.
 *
 * `moveNumber` is a half-move index, derived from the position rather than counted from the log —
 * the same rule the iOS companion and the backend follow, so both clients name a ply identically.
 * Draw and resign entries carry the *current* position, which makes this the number of the move
 * they precede: they deliberately share that move's slot, and the backend keeps one row per played
 * ply while letting actions sit alongside it.
 *
 * This client used to number every entry `max + 1` instead, treating the column as an opaque log
 * sequence. That was self-consistent, but it drifted a slot ahead of the FEN-derived numbering as
 * soon as both sides acted on one draw offer — and in a mixed game against iOS the drift landed
 * our move on the number iOS had reserved for the *next* ply, so the backend rejected that ply as
 * a divergence and dropped it from the history.
 *
 * FEN fields: `[position] [side] [castling] [ep] [halfclock] [fullmove]`. White's first move is 1,
 * black's is 2, white's second is 3. Falls back to 1 on a FEN this can't read, matching the
